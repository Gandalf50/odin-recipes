        <p>This recipe will teach you the basic procedure to make a homemade pizza that you can use to surprise your friends, idk, just learn how to make pizza, who wouldn't want to learn that?</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Levadura</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Idk, other stuff</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough</li>
            <li>Divide it into how many pizzas you want, save a fist-sized piece of dough for each pizza</li>
            <li>Wait for it to grow, at least an hour</li>
            <li>Give each piece of dough the size you want your pizza to be and throw it in the oven</li>
            <li>Once it's cooked - looks brownish - get it out of the oven, turn it upside down, throw some souce on top and add some cheese, then throw it back in the oven</li>
            <li>Repeat this proces with each pizza</li>
            <li>Once the cheese is all melted down, take the pizza out of the oven and throw it on some nice flat surface - not the floor - so you can cur it out on how many slices you want</li>
            <li>If you wanna add some other ingredients on top like pineapple - why not, right? - you should do so before cutting the slices so that it's easier to distribute everything evenly</li>
            <li>Throw your pizza to the garbage</li>
            <li>Order some good pizza from someone who knows what they're doing</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
        </ol>
