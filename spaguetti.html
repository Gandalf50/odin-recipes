    <p>Whatever dude, you know what spaghetti is, what are you lloking for in a description</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil some water</li>
        <li>Once it boils throw some salt in it, then throw the pasta in it too</li>
        <li>Make sure theres no pasta not fully submerged, just pay some attention, willya?</li>
        <li>Wait until it's done, move it around with a fork every now and then so it doesn't all stick together</li>
        <li>Taste the tip of one when you think it's done to be sure, just don't wait too long or it'll lose all flavour and texture</li>
        <li>Get it out of the water and in a plate</li>
        <li>You better have done a sauce to go with it, otherwise it's gonna be pretty plain</li>
        <li>Enjoy I guess, I hope you remembered to turn off the stove</li>
    </ol>
